# Python-Code

This folder contains code that I wrote using Python. Some scripts might need others that are not present due to discretionary reasons. 
 
## Installation
 
Make sure to have Python version 3 and up installed with the appropriate libraries associated with each script. 
  
## Usage
 
To be used for evaluating previously coded scripts as well as potentially providing feedback.
